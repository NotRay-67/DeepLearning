# Title: Binary Classification Deep Learning Model for Cat and Dog Images

## Abstract:
This project implements a deep learning model for binary classification of cat and dog images using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, consisting of images of various cat and dog breeds. The model architecture comprises convolutional neural network (CNN) layers followed by dense layers for classification. The model is trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its performance.
